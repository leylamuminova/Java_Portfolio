Developed a maze-solving engine using stack- and queue-based agendas to implement DFS and BFS traversal. Built neighbor-generation logic, path reconstruction, and visualized search progress. 
Demonstrates algorithm design, data-structure implementation, and systematic problem-solving—skills directly aligned with analytical and model-driven finance roles.
